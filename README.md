# WestMacropadWorkshop2025
This repository is intended to guide the user through the design of a small Macropad using KiCAD for schematic capture and PCB layout, fusion 360 for enclosure design, and QMK as the foundation for firmware.

> Students should be guided through the material by an instructor, there's not enough info for this repository to stand on its own (yet)

Quick Start
1) Clone this repository to your local machine starting with "0_NewProject"
2) The repository is confirgured for a 2-layer (or 4-layer) design at JLCPCB
    - DRC is already configured
    - Custom footprints created based on the "basic" macropad, see "west_footprints" library
    - Custom 3d models linked to footprints to simplify enclosure design
    - **NOTE - You main need to fix some paths when you first setup the project, as many links use ABSOLUTE not RELATIVE paths.**
