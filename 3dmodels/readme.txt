\3dmodels

Overview:
Folder contains all 3D CAD relevant to this project.
When a project revision is released, all relevant models should be archived to the release folder revX.
The FW revision and PCBA revision should always be identical.
If there were no changes to CAD, leave breadcrumbs in the form of readme's.
